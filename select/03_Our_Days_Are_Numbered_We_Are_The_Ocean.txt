Oh, this is terrifying, I'm counting down the days 'til I end up in the ground
Oh, this is terrifying, I'll keep a close eye on my time, I beg you not to end this yet

But there must be something after this, there must be something

Well, I've forgotten what it feels like to know you've got it all to come
So let's pretend, so let's pretend that we're young again

Oh, this is terrifying, I'm scared that I'll wake up one day with nothing left to do
Oh, this is terrifying, I'm trying hard to see this through without the fear that I'll die soon

I won't let it ruin the years that I have, I won't let it ruin

Well, I've forgotten what it feels like to know you've got it all to come
So let's pretend, so let's pretend that we're young again

Save your breath now, save your breath now
Save your breath now, save your breath now
