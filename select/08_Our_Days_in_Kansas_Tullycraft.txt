Did you mean what you said when you told me you missed us
Without reservation, without plans for Christmas
First part was right, the rest wasn't true
The same goes for me and the same goes for you

Packed my things for the month but it's not necessary
I told you I'd stay but it's just temporary
Like swastika girls who fell back on their looks
We relied on the tricks and the recycled hooks

Did you want a response or just someone to edit?
It's not what you said, it's the way that you said it
The longshoreman's daughter, when they spelled her name
Found three chords of brilliance and rode them to fame, all alone

Pep up the formula tonight
You're not obliged to do us favors
Disenchanted hearts unite
When you and I were candy ravers
Krushchev's Ekranoplan had failed
Those weeks in August never seem fair
Our love is left to sink or sail
You cut the summer blonde from your hair

A little time is all I need
A disco bloodbath for the ages
The patience left to let it bleed
And a quill to fill the pages

Side streets set ablaze
And all roads lead to maybe
Sometimes I think about those days
Sometimes I wish we'd kept the baby
I don't know how things could have changed
At the latest

Our days in Kansas wouldn't last
I never learned the KU fight song
Exchanging poisons from the past
I hadn't heard from you in so long

And if the moonlight kills the flame
With all the moments we were meant to
You know I'll tell the world your name
I couldn't let the world forget you

Things were so much easier back in 1993
I loved you for the first time on that day
