I'm sorry I missed you waking up
And I couldn't be there, I was rough
And every time you say it's not enough
It takes a sign post to turn you around

You say our days are numbered
You say our days are numbered

I wonder what you get out of feeling sober and proud
It's like you've never been happy and it's all coming out
I wonder what you put in to watch me drown as you swim
It's like you've never been happy and it's all coming out

Part of the fun is making up
'Cos even the neighbours say enough's enough
And I can't begin to calm you down
It takes a stop sign to turn you around

You say our days are numbered
You say our days are numberеd

I wonder what you get out of feeling sober and proud
It's likе you've never been happy and it's all coming out
I wonder what you put in to watch me drown as you swim
It's like you've never been happy and it's all coming out

I wonder what you get out of feeling sober and proud
It's like you've never been happy and it's all coming out
I wonder what you put in to watch me drown as you swim
It's like you've never been happy and it's all coming out
