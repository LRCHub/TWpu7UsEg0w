Goodbyes are sometimes too long
Just think of it moving on
I'll pray you're coming along
And when we hang up the phone
I'll remember our days

Did you meet all your plans
And smile, the time that we spend
If I don't see you again
I'm glad that you were my friend
I'll remember our days

I'll miss our days on the phone
The pride forever stays strong
I'll pray you're coming along
And when we hang up the phone
I'll remember our days

Did you meet all your plans
And smile, the time that we spend
If I don't see you again
I'm glad that you were my friend
I'll remember our days
